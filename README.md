# Notepad++ VDF Language Plugins

An updated version of the Valve Developer Format plugins for NotePad++.

Place the `XML` files into `%appdata%\notepad++\uderdefinelangs\` and restart NotePad++ for them to take effect. 

It would be better to remove the old combined VDF language file from your NP++ root folder before installing these to prevent conflicts.
